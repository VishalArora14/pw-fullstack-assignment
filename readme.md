# Steps to reproduce on local machine :

### 2)npm i
### 3)cd .\pwassign\
### 4)npm i
### 5)cd..

## I have also uploaded some screenshots of the website showing all the features like : 

### 1)Select the center from the center dropdown then the room number dropdown will be populated with all room values in that center.

### 2)Search box: live search and filtering of rows and search query can be anything like file name, teacher name, start time, end time or room number.

### 3)Clear-sort and clear filter button to clear all the applied filters and sorting.

### 4)Sort from column headings. Click on the column heading to sort in ascending or descending order.

### 5)Pagination: Since there could be a lot of entries all should not be displayed on the same page. We can travel across pages and check which page number we are on currently.

## I scraped data from the webpage.

## Backend : 

### Created APIs.
### It has API routing and made controllers to handle get requests on the API.

## FrontEnd : 

### Used Redux store to store data in the frontend. Now it can be accessed in any component for further scaling this website.
### Created table manually without any external packages.
### Made searching, sorting and filter functions on the frontend for final data filtering.
### Created functions for pagination.
